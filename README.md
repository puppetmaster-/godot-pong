# godot-pong
Demo project for Godot Engine 2.1 (a more godot like pong)

This is not the source code for the original godot pong tutorial! (http://docs.godotengine.org/en/2.1/learning/step_by_step/simple_2d_game.html)

I created this demo project to have a more godot like pong game for beginners to learn.

This is what you get:
- build on modules (single scenes for ball, pads, gui, ...)
- moving KinematicBody2D with collisions
- Area2d and StaticBody2D
- connect signals
- working with timers
- working with groups
- pause game
- scene loaded in AutoLoad
- export variables
- export variables with setget
- variables with onready
- tool mode
- CanvasLayer for gui and background
- instancing a scene
- call_group function

Feel free to study it and leave me some feedback.
